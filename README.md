### Hello World 👋

I am Drew! I am a Data Science experimenter. 

Data is at the heart of our generation's defining technology, and I am grateful to be able to work with it. 

I was formally educated at LearningFuze Bootcamp in Irvine, California, and also use CodeCademy and other various online resources to continue self development. 

Woohoo!!

Here are areas of Data I find interesting to Explore:
- 🏀 Sports Analysis (but not forgetting about the heart of a champion)
- 🔮 Predictive Modelling (this is a new area of interest)
- 🤖 Machine Learning (very much an area I am constantly growing in)
